3.7.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- All interfaces, as well as some authentication-related helper classes and
  functions (checkPrincipal, PrincipalSource, PrincipalTerms, etc.) were moved
  into the new ``zope.authentication`` package. Backward-compatibility imports
  are provided.

- The IPrincipal -> zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo
  adapter was moved to ``zope.publisher``. Backward-compatibility import
  is provided.

- The PermissionsVocabulary and PermissionIdsVocabulary has been moved
  to the ``zope.security`` package. Backward-compatibility imports are
  provided.

- The registration of the "zope.Public" permission has been moved to
  ``zope.security``. Its configure.zcml is now included by this package.

- The ``LocalPermission`` class is now moved to new ``zope.localpermission``
  package. This package now only has backward-compatibility imports and browser
  views and menu items for ZMI.

- The browser views and menu item for ``LocalPermission`` was moved into a
  separate `browser/localpermission.zcml` file that is included by
  `browser/configure.zcml`. This adds a possibility to exclude ZMI-related
  configuration for local permissions.

3.6.2 (2009-03-10)
------------------

- The `Allow`, `Deny` and `Unset` permission settings was preferred to
  be imported from ``zope.securitypolicy.interfaces`` for a long time
  and now they are completely moved there from ``zope.app.security.settings``
  as well as the ``PermissionSetting`` class. The only thing left for
  backward compatibility is the import of Allow/Unset/Deny constants if
  ``zope.securitypolicy`` is installed to allow unpickling of security
  settings.

3.6.1 (2009-03-09)
------------------

- Depend on new ``zope.password`` package instead of ``zope.app.authentication``
  to get password managers for the authentication utility, thus remove
  dependency on ``zope.app.authentication``.

- Use template for AuthUtilitySearchView instead of ugly HTML
  constructing in the python code.

- Bug: The `sha` and `md5` modules has been deprecated in Python 2.6.
  Whenever the ZCML of this package was included when using Python 2.6,
  a deprecation warning had been raised stating that `md5` and `sha` have
  been deprecated. Provided a simple condition to check whether Python 2.6
  or later is installed by checking for the presense of `json` module
  thas was added only in Python 2.6 and thus optionally load the security
  declaration for `md5` and `sha`.

- Remove deprecated code, thus removing explicit dependency on
  zope.deprecation and zope.deferredimport.

- Cleanup code a bit, replace old __used_for__ statements by ``adapts``
  calls.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Changed mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because
  zope3-dev is retired now. Changed "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in
  the package homepage.

- Moved the `protectclass` module to `zope.security` leaving only a
  compatibility module here that imports from the new location.

- Moved the <module> directive implementation to `zope.security`.

- Use `zope.container` instead of `zope.app.container`;.

3.5.3 (2008-12-11)
------------------

- use zope.browser.interfaces.ITerms instead of
  `zope.app.form.browser.interfaces`.

3.5.2 (2008-07-31)
------------------

- Bug: It turned out that checking for regex was not much better of an
  idea, since it causes deprecation warnings in Python 2.4. Thus let's
  look for a library that was added in Python 2.5.

3.5.1 (2008-06-24)
------------------

- Bug: The `gopherlib` module has been deprecated in Python 2.5. Whenever the
  ZCML of this package was included when using Python 2.5, a deprecation
  warning had been raised stating that `gopherlib` has been
  deprecated. Provided a simple condition to check whether Python 2.5 or later
  is installed by checking for the deleted `regex` module and thus optionally
  load the security declaration for `gopherlib`.

3.5.0 (2008-02-05)
------------------

- Feature:
  `zope.app.security.principalregistry.PrincipalRegistry.getPrincipal` returns
  `zope.security.management.system_user` when its id is used for the search
  key.

3.4.0 (2007-10-27)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
